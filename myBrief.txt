- I tried added simple authentication, make whole project separated in files for better readability, 
- Made a mess for not using socket.io form start for real time communication
- Saw on the end that I forgor status checking for messages
- Redux store was not necessary for my solution
- In my opinion Backend is better structured and written
- You can track my progress in commits
- Thank you for your time
